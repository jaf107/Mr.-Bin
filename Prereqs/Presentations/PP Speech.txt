Feature set is vast. 
mode of operation for any ad is exchange, recycle and donation. In each operation, the seller uploads the commodity informations which includes images. duration of use, manufacturing year,present condition, defects and description.
A seller needs to select the mode of operation and through this, the other end user i.e. the buyer/ recycler in order to finalize the trade.
